/*
A, B each are playing bowling. They are trying to choose different weight of bowling bowl from each other.
There are total N bowling balls. Each weighing from range of 1-M kg. There may be some balls that weight the same.
Write a code that calculates how many combinations A,B can have

EX) N = 5, M = 3, arr = 1,3,2,3,2

ans = (1,3), (1,2), (1,3), (1,2), (3,2), (3,2), (2,3), (3,2) - therefore there are 8 ways
